# 🛒 Walmart Retail Sales Analysis
 # 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart’s historical retail sales data (2010–2012) using SQL. The goal is to uncover insights on store performance, sales volatility, holiday impacts, and long-term sales trends.

# 📂 Dataset

The dataset comes from [Kaggle – Walmart Dataset (Retail)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rutuspatel/walmart-dataset-retail).
It includes:  
Store – Store number  
Date – Week of sales
